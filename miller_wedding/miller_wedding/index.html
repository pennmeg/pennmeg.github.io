          <h3>Moments</h3>
          <p id="intro">From the West Coast and the Prairies, we both ended up in Washington D.C. for a Master's degree.
          We met at orientation at The George Washington University, and <em>it wasn't exactly love at first sight.</em>
          Megan spilled wine all over the floor of the apartment,
          and Joshua teased Megan relentlessly for her "Canadianess" the entire evening.
          However we continued being friends and through our <em>love</em> for pizza, a few vacations, and giving the word <em>sloth</em>
          a new meaning we were married on Friday, March 18, 2016 surrounded by a handful of our loved ones.
          We wish you all could have joined us, but hope you enjoy some of the moments that we have pulled together
          from that day and our relationship. Find out more about our love story below or skip straight to the wedding photos!</p>
